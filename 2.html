<p>Smooth like butter<br>
Like a criminal undercover<br>
Gon' pop like trouble<br>
Breakin' into your heart like that<br>
Cool shade stunner<br>
Yeah, I owe it all to my mother<br>
Hot like summer<br>
Yeah, I'm makin' you sweat like that<br>
Break it down</p>
<p>Oh, when I look in the mirror<br>
I'll melt your heart into two<br>
I got that superstar glow so (Ooh)<br>
Do the boogie like</p>
<p>Side step, right, left to my beat (Heartbeat)<br>
High like the moon, rock with me, baby<br>
Know that I got that heat<br>
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap<br>
Side step, right, left to my beat (Heartbeat)<br>
Get it, let it roll</p>
<p>Smooth like butter<br>
Pull you in like no other<br>
Don't need no Usher<br>
To remind me you got it bad<br>
Ain't no other<br>
That can sweep you up like a robber<br>
Straight up, I got ya<br>
Makin' you fall like that<br>
Break it down</p>
<p>Oh, when I look in the mirror<br>
I'll melt your heart into two<br>
I got that superstar glow so (Ooh)<br>
Do the boogie like</p>
<p>Side step, right, left to my beat (Heartbeat)<br>
High like the moon, rock with me, baby<br>
Know that I got that heat<br>
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap<br>
Side step, right, left to my beat (Heartbeat)<br>
Get it, let it roll<br>
Get it, let it roll<br>
Get it, let it roll</p>
<p>No ice on my wrist<br>
I'm that n-ice guy<br>
Got that right body and that right mind<br>
Rollin' up to party got the right vibe<br>
Smooth like butter<br>
Hate us love us<br>
Fresh boy pull up and we lay low<br>
All the playas get movin' when the bass low<br>
Got ARMY right behind us when we say so<br>
Let's go</p>
<p>Side step, right, left to my beat (Right left to my beat)<br>
High like the moon, rock with me, baby<br>
Know that I got that heat<br>
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)<br>
Side step, right, left to my beat (Heartbeat)<br>
Get it, let it roll</p>
<p>Smooth like (Butter)<br>
Cool shade (Stunner)<br>
And you know we don't stop<br>
Hot like (Summer)<br>
Ain't no (Bummer)<br>
You be like oh my god<br>
We gon' make you rock and you say (Yeah)<br>
We gon' make you bounce and you say (Yeah)<br>

Get it? Let it roll</p></body>
